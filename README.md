<strong>Iteration 1: </strong><br />

Initialized a hash map that will store our list of todo's. The key for this map will be the timestamp at which the ToDo was added. <br />
Added functionality to add/remove todo's from the overall list <br />
Added function to sort todos alphabetically <br />

<br />

<strong>Iteration 2: </strong> <br />

What user stories were completed this iteration?  <br />
A user can now sort todos alphabetically  <br />
A user can now filter todos in reverse alphabetical order  <br />
A user can now edit a todo  <br />
A user can now add sub-todos to each existing todo  <br />

What user stories do you intend to complete next iteration?  <br />
A user will be albe to filter todos by date created  <br />
A user will be able to assing a level of urgency to todos  <br />
A user will be able to see the completion percentage of each todo based on the number of sub-todos completed  <br />

Is there anything that you implemented but doesn't currently work?  <br />
